Install the regulatory beacons and signs to secure the work area. 8. Lower the conductor of the section to be replaced. 9. Cut off all the defective part of the conductor. 10. Position the 1st sleeve on the end of the conductor and crimp. 11. Take a length of conductor equivalent to that cut and crimp on one end. 12. Use frogs, a hoist or pull lift to pull the 2 13. Position the 2nd sleeve on the 2nd end and perform the crimp. 14. Remove the frogs, the hoist and the pull lift. 15. Replace the conductor on the clamp or insulator. 16. Remove grounds and store beacons. 17. Thoroughly clean the site. 18. Store materials and tools. 19. Bring the whole team together and debrief. 20.

The consequences of a short circuit can be serious and include risk of fire, damage to electrical equipment, disturbances in the electrical network, power outages and injury to persons nearby.Overcurrents caused by a short circuit can trip protective devices such as circuit breakers for isolate the faulty part of the network and prevent further damage. Identifying and resolving short circuits quickly is essential to maintaining the safety and reliability of the electrical network.",
